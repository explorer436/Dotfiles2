* How do I find out the class for an application to assign it to a workspace in i3?

How can we determine the class of an application so that we can use the assign function, aside from trial and error.
e.g. I'd like Libre Office Writer assigned to workspace 3, and Calc assigned to workspace 4.

** Option 1

You can run the following command in terminal

#+begin_src
xprop | grep WM_CLASS | awk '{ print $4 }'
#+end_src

Then click in the window you want to get class from, then it will print the class name in the terminal.

** Option 2

Use the file ./i3-get-window-criteria.sh

Prerequisite: xorg-xwininfo

#+begin_src
paru -S xorg-xwininfo
#+end_src
