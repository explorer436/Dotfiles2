" Before using this, visit the github project for vim-plug for instructions about installing plugged.
" https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
" We need to run a command to Download plug.vim and put it in the "autoload" directory.
" We may need to toggle this on and off for installing plugins when behind a
" corporate firewall.

"
"   Using Coc language servers:
"   Once Coc.nvim has been installed, you need to install some language server extensions to provide intellisense support for JavaScript and Typescript projects. 
"   You can so so with :CocInstall.
"   :CocInstall coc-tsserver coc-json
"   With coc-tsserver, you get so many features that make writing, debugging and refactoring JavaScript or Typescript a breeze. 
"   Without configuring anything, auto-completion should just work and you can see function signatures and relevant suggestions as you type.

"   You can use the very nice :CocSearch to search and replace text across multiple files in the working directory.
"   Prerequisite for CocSearch: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
"   Usage details -
"   :CocSearch searchPattern
"   This command will open a new bufferr with the results of your CocSearch.
"
"   Change and save:
"
"   Refactor session is started with searched patterns highlighted, just
"   change the text and save refactor buffer to make changes across all
"   related files. You can make any kind of changes, including add lines
"   and remove lines.

"What vim color schemes are installed?
"You can find your installed vim colorscheme files in the colors subdirectory of your vim installation directory.
"All the files end with the file extension .vim, and begin with the name of the colorscheme.
"In Linux, these are usually found here : /usr/share/vim/vim72/colors"
"The location might be different in Windows machines.

"------------------------------
" If Vim keeps complaining about not finding the color scheme at start-up,
" copy the gruvbox.vim file to Vim colors file.

" In Linux, it is usually at /usr/share/vim/vim82/colors
" In Linux, follow one of these two approaches.
" 1. Get gruvbox plug-in using a plugin manager; Go to /home/explorer436/.vim/plugged/gruvbox/colors/" and run this command: cp gruvbox.vim /usr/share/vim/vim82/colors
" Or just download the plugin from a browser and then copy the file from the
" downloaded folder to vim's colors folder.
