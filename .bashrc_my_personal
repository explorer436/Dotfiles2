# Why create a file called .bashrc_personal?
# Put all your personal aliases in there.
# They will not be overwritten by skel.
# Just import your .bashrc_personal into the one you copy from skel and it should just be plug and play without interfering with the .bashrc settings provided by the distribution

# Remember to do this everytime you set up the Dotfiles repository
# Idea: There exist backup copies of .bashrc, .profile etc. in /etc/skel/.
# http://www.linfo.org/etc_skel.html
# So one could replace a corrupt .bashrc simply by overwitting from there.
# Copy the existing raw .bashrc from /etc/skel to your home directory by
# cp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/
# Make sure you put this line in .bashrc (or .zprofile if it is a Macbook) after copying it from skel: [[ -f ~/.bashrc_my_personal ]] && . ~/.bashrc_my_personal

# This is to import .bash_aliases into .bashrc_personal. You don't have to import it into .bashrc again.
[[ -f ~/.bash_my_aliases ]] && . ~/.bash_my_aliases
