;; First, we must set the value of org-refile-targets, which tells Org how to find the possible targets. Be sure to read the documentation for this variable, because there are a few ways to define targets, but for this scenario, I want to be able to move a node to any of my agenda files, and I also want to consider nodes up to three levels deep.

;; Thatâ€™s exactly what this setting will do.

;; (setq org-refile-targets '((org-agenda-files :maxlevel . 3)))

;; With this set, you can trigger Refile with C-c C-w in any Org file and get a completing read of all headings up to three levels deep in all files in org-agenda-files.

;; If you use Helm, which you really should, you will see a very pretty hierarchical display of possible targets. You can type a filename to narrow down to headings within that file, and so on.
