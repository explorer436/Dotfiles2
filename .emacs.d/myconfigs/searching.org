* isearch

    This is built-in to emacs. Don't have to install anything.

     https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-06-10-emacs-search-replace-basics/

     Display a counter showing the number of the current and the other matches.  Place it before the prompt, though it can be after it.

     #+begin_src elisp
     (setq isearch-lazy-count t)
     (setq lazy-count-prefix-format "(%s/%s) ")
     (setq lazy-count-suffix-format nil)
     #+end_src

     Make regular Isearch interpret the empty space as a regular expression that matches any character between the words you give it.

     #+begin_src elisp
     (setq search-whitespace-regexp ".*?")
     #+end_src

     Install the ~wgrep~ package.  It makes the grep buffers editable.

     Install the ~consult~ package.  It provides lots of useful commands that enhance the minibuffer experience of Emacs (e.g. for searching lines/heading).

     Install the ~embark~ package.  It allows you to perform context-sensitive actions, using a prompt and then a key/action selection interface.

* rg

    Use rg in emacs

    #+begin_src elisp
      (use-package rg
	:ensure t
	:config
	(rg-enable-default-bindings)
      )
    #+end_src

    To edit the results buffer, you need to wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode

    Make the search results editable by enabling ~wgrep~ mode.  When done press ~C-c C-c~ to commit your changes to the underlying files or ~C-c C-k~ to drop the changes.

    See https://programming-notes.explorer436.com/posts/20250617120709-emacs_rename_something_in_an_entire_project/

    You can save the results of a particular search by using the letter ~s~

    You can navigate to it exactly the same way you navigate to all the buffers - using ~Ctrl X b~

* fzf

  https://github.com/bling/fzf.el

  #+begin_src elisp
  (use-package fzf
    :ensure t
  ;; :bind
  ;; Don't forget to set keybinds!
  :config
  (setq fzf/args "-x --color bw --print-query --margin=1,0 --no-hscroll"
	fzf/executable "fzf"
	fzf/git-grep-args "-i --line-number %s"
	;; command used for `fzf-grep-*` functions
	;; example usage for ripgrep:
	;; fzf/grep-command "rg --no-heading -nH"
	fzf/grep-command "grep -nrH"
	;; If nil, the fzf buffer will appear at the top of the window
	fzf/position-bottom t
	fzf/window-height 15))
  #+end_src

* How to grep for something and limit the search to certain file types?

e.g. search only in org files in the current repo

#+begin_src
M-x consult-ripgrep <search-term> -- -g *.org
#+end_src

If you don't have ~consult~ installed, just use plain ~rg~. Matter of fact, if we use ~rg~, we don't even have to remember the command above, because, ~rg~ will prompt us about the file types that it needs to search in and the parent directory to search in.

* If I have consult, do I still need swiper?

You do not necessarily need Swiper if you have Consult, as Consult provides  as a direct alternative to Swiper.
Many users successfully replace Swiper entirely with the Consult stack (often including Vertico and Orderless).
However, some users may find Swiper offers specific features that  does not, which might justify using both or sticking with Swiper:

** Key Differences between consult-line and swiper

| Feature              | Swiper                                                                                                                                                | Consult-line                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Search Functionality | A "replacement" for  that displays search results as a vertical list and highlights them in the buffer, allowing for easy navigation between matches. | A line-based filter command that shows matching lines in the minibuffer but does not inherently provide functionality to move between matches in the main buffer in the same way Swiper does. |
| Navigation           | Allows moving between matches using  (next) and  (previous) keybindings (with default Ivy/Swiper settings or evil-mode bindings).                     | Requires additional configuration or complementary packages (like; Emacs' built-in; or Avy) for quick jumping to specific lines or navigating matches in the buffer.                          |
| Integration          | Tightly integrated with the; Ivy completion framework; and the; Counsel package; , forming a complete, opinionated suite.                             | Designed to use Emacs' built-in  interface, making it compatible with various completion engines like; Vertico; , Icomplete, and Selectrum.                                                   |
| Philosophy           | An organically grown package with many features and options.                                                                                          | A simpler, lighter-weight package that adheres to the standard Emacs API, often relying on other small, focused packages (Marginalia, Embark) to add functionality.                           |

1. If you prefer a lightweight setup that uses standard Emacs APIs and enjoy the Consult way of interacting with search results,  is likely all you need and you can drop Swiper.
1. If you rely heavily on -like navigation (jumping directly to the next/previous match within the buffer using simple keybindings) as provided by Swiper's default behavior, you might miss that specific functionality in , and could keep Swiper or configure a custom solution. [3, 10, 11, 13, 14]
