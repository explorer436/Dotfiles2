;; How to navigate by sentences in a paragraph? M-a Move back to the beginning of the sentence (backward-sentence). M-e Move forward to the end of the sentence (forward-sentence).
;; See C-h i g (emacs) Sentences for full details.
;; Take particular note of this:
;; The sentence commands assume that you follow the American typistâ€™s convention of putting two spaces at the end of a sentence. That is, a sentence ends wherever there is a ., ? or ! followed by the end of a line or two spaces, with any number of ), ], ', or " characters allowed in between. A sentence also begins or ends wherever a paragraph begins or ends. It is useful to follow this convention, because it allows the Emacs sentence commands to distinguish between periods that end a sentence and periods that indicate abbreviations.
;; If you want to use just one space between sentences, you can set the variable sentence-end-double-space to nil to make the sentence commands stop for single spaces. However, this has a drawback: there is no way to distinguish between periods that end sentences and those that indicate abbreviations. For convenient and reliable editing, we therefore recommend you follow the two-space convention.
